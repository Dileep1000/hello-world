# hello-world
This is my first GitHub Repository! 

**1. Random typing**
I am basically following the hello-world tutorial for the first assignment of WPR281, 
I never thought that something like this would be an actual assignment!

**2. About myself?!?**
I am a 2nd year BCOMP student at the Belgium Campus ITversity, currently not in sync with all uni work,
but still managing to pull through with fairly good results!
